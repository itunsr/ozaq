译）作为敬献给大地的礼物，算是我们听到的稍有大地之书资讯的一个音符。梭罗本人就是一个优秀的土地测量员，以后又只身进入“瓦尔登湖”两年，去洞察生活的本相。他当然不是有意识的去阅读书写大地，但在有意无意之间还是领略到了一些大地的风景。他在充分体味大自然的韵律节奏后，站在美不胜收的瓦尔登湖畔倾心诉说：“记住你年轻时候的创造力。黎明之前你就无忧无虑地起来，出发探险去。让正午看到你在另一个湖边。夜来时，到处为家。没有比这里更广大的土地了，也没有比这样做更有价值的游戏了。按照你的天性而狂放地生活，好比那芦苇和羊齿，它们是永远不会变成英吉利干草的啊。让雷霆咆哮；对稼穑有害，这又有什么关系呢？这并不是给你的信息。他们要躲在车下，木屋下，你可以躲在云下。你不要再以手艺为生，应该以游戏为生。只管欣赏大地，可不要想去占有。……”（《倍克田庄》）。在梭罗的“大地之书”中，大地不管怎么说已经被当作一个审美对象了。这是有关大地的书写的一个进步。在深入剖析了生活世像之后，作者甚至在名篇《瓦尔登湖》的篇末对游离在自然之外的人类警告说：“白湖和瓦尔登湖是大地表面上的两块巨大的水晶，它们是光耀的湖。……它们太纯洁，不能有市场价格，它们没被污染。它们比起我们的生命来，不知美了多少！我们从不知道它们有什么瑕疵。……可是有哪个少男或少女，是同大自然的粗犷华丽的美协调的呢？大自然极其寂寞地繁茂着，远离着他们居住的乡镇。说甚天堂！你侮辱大地。”无庸赘叙，在这里，作家以笔为，为大地的尊严进行了最初的搏击。虽然，他的书仍不是那种纯粹的大地之书，毕竟接触到这一主题了。然后我们的目光转移到另一个被誉为“美国自然保护之父”的业余作家奥尔多?利奥波德（Aldo
This way can't get enough with the proud.
Smith's "the wealth of nations", "on" PASCAL, Russell's "path to freedom", the bible, the Koran, camus's the plague, and toth drag, the insulted and the injured, solzhenitsyn's "the gulag archipelago", George gissing "four seasons of essays" and so on, and my reading interest lies not in the literature books, and to social science and natural science.
Also say that I like the man, who works has the edge, drawing on the successful experience of them, I don't think it is a bad behavior, but I am opposed to archaic and blindly worship and imitation, I ask, is the purpose of me, it must be my own, rather than anybody.
I want to, a variety of factors together, then can expand themselves, achievement.
About technique, there are three in the prose writing technique, one is the technique of language, this seems to be the technical behavior of low-level, because language is a natural good, how comfortable how to use, rather than to play, like a pot of flowers, just give her a green leaves, then draw a tiger isn't the kind of dog.
Technique, 2 it is technology that, as a new prose writers like pure, connotation, technical support, is also a common phenomenon, which is also on many writers.
Three is technical thought, many people around in the form of prose thought, my advice is: prose is no thought, nor too much thought, prose is after all a little style, like a sports car, just want it to go to war carrying guns, it is sure to backfire.
Nature, the way nature itself, I think Lao tzu's "tao" study on the relationship between the processing technology and the connotation is instructive.
